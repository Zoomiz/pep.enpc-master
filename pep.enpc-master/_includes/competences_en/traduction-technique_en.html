        OUR EXPERIENCE
    </h5>
    <p>
        Les Ponts students have been used to technical translations for many years now. For instance, Les Ponts teaching requires that reports on internships abroad be written in French and in the language of the country of the internship.
    </p>
    <h5>OUR TRAINING</h5>
    <p>
        Every student at Les Ponts is required to study at least two foreign languages during their studies and to spend a semester in a foreign country, guaranteeing a high level of language excellence. In addition, diplomas in these languages (TOEIC, TOEFL, GRE) are required by the Ecole des Ponts teaching.
